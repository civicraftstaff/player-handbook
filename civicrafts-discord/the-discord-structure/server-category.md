## S-Announcements

S-Announcements or Server Announcements is a channel that contains announcements relevant to the staff side of server operations. The majority of notifications in the channel are optional and can be opted into by obtaining the "Server News" role! However, some messages deemed as important will be accompanied by an @everyone tag. Some examples of when an everyone tag comes into play are as follows:&#x20;

* **A major update:** CiviCraft updates in bug fixes, minor updates, and major updates. Major updates are ones that add completely new features that may impact gameplay and are important for players to be aware of.
* **Warnings:** Every so often, things happen that everyone needs to be warned about. Many of these warnings are outside of our control, such as the Log4j exploit that plagued servers in December 2021. These warnings will always be made with the intention to keep our players safe.
* **Rule Updates:** We believe everyone deserves a fair chance when it comes to moderation. Therefore, any rules changes or updates made will be broadcasted to the server so everyone is aware of the change and can behave accordingly if it is relevant to them.
* **Quarterly Feedback:** To improve as a server and hear the players' concerns, the staff team runs feedback surveys very often. The majority of these surveys will not be accompanied with an @everyone tag, though will be shared extensively. However, we do have 4 feedback surveys that will go out to everyone every 3 months.
* **Other:** There may be times when we find ourselves announcing things to everyone that we did not plan to. These will be incredibly minimal!

All other notifications that you can be informed of with the Server News role will be things such as staff promotions or staff departures, scheduled downtime for maintenance, and more.

## &#x20;G-Announcements

G-Announcements or Government Announcements is a channel that contains announcements relevant to the government side of server operations. The announcements may vary from information on elections, court summons, department news and updates, and so much more. Therefore, we have designated specific roles so that players may choose what is of interest to them and get notified specifically for that purpose:

* **Legal Updates:** Notifications for when things occur in the legal world. Changes to the courts, promotions, legal summons, and more.
* **Department Updates:** Notifications for all changes made in government departments. For example, if a department adds a new role or policy, they will inform others through this tag in the channel.
* **Election Updates:** Notifications for elections. Get informed on when declarations open, when elections start, and the results of the elections. If there are any changes to the election process, they will be published under this, as well.
* **Congressional Updates:** Notifications from Congress.

## Events

The Events channel contains information on events and is separated by Government Events and Fun Events. Government Events refer to events hosted by every department and each government branch besides the Department of Public Affairs. The Department of Public Affairs's events fall under Fun Events. I should rewrite this.

## Info-Rules-Roles

Info-Rules-Roles contains information, rules, and roles. The channel is formatted in the same order as the channel names. The information section contains general things about the server such as a short history, the IP, and how to join. Rules contains the rules of the discord server and of the Minecraft server. Lastly, roles contains all the opt-in roles you can select to customize your notifications.
